ASSIGNMENT 4 :

1. SpringBoot Application -- Jenkins Pipeline (groovy script) -- which needs to be pushed to GitHub Repository that includes: a) git checkout b) build & test using jenkins runtime maven c) build docker image using jenkins runtime docker d) push the image to dockerhub using withcredentials plugin e) deploying the docker image to PCF 
2. War-test --> checkout, mvn build & test and deploy to tomcat locally -- again this as well needs to be done using Jenkins pipeline -- however, a screenshot of Jenkins pipeline (groovy script) suffice here and push the screenshot doc as well to GitHub Repo.
